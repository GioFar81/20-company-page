# CODECADEMY CHALLENGE PROJECT: COMPANY HOMEPAGE.

For this project, we are required to create a company homepage from scratch. The guideline is quite broad, giving us plenty of space for
experimentation.

1. The company can either be real or fictional.
2. We get to choose what to include, how to position it and style it.
3. We should include a title and logo.
4. A statement.
5. Images to represent the products of the company.
6. A section for the employees.
7. Use flexbox.
8. Custom styles such as colours, fonts, etc.

After setting up the folder structure and initial files, I started to look at colours palettes and fonts. For the time being, I will use the
Roboto font from Google as the main font, and I also have a second font that I might use, Signika Negative, again from Google.

For the colours, I created this [colour palette](img/extra/colours.jpg). I wanted to include an almost white and an almost black option, a
few muted colours in different tones, and a colour a bit bolder, although not too saturated or fluorescent. I want to keep text either white
or black, and because of that, I had darkened a bit one of the colours to be able to get a text contrast of at least 4.6:1, the rest of the
colours give me at least a contrast of 9+.

When choosing the colours, I made sure that they were spreading across the [tonal range](img/extra/tones.jpg) to keep a natural contrast,
and that they were all distinguishable also for [colour-blind](img/extra/colour-blindness.jpg) users.
